The following CSS code snippet is designed to style an image, making it responsive and preventing it from exceeding its container's width:

```css
img {
  max-width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}
```

However, in some instances, it unexpectedly causes the image to be smaller than the container, even when there's enough space.

This occurs primarily when the image's aspect ratio differs significantly from the container's aspect ratio, leading to an unintended scaling effect. The `max-width: 100%;` works as intended, but due to the `height: auto;`, the height is calculated proportionally, potentially making the entire image smaller than necessary.
